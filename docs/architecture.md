# Falcon Agent Architecture

This document provides detailed information about the Falcon Agent system architecture.

## System Overview

Falcon Agent is a multi-agent system designed to autonomously develop enterprise-level code from natural language requirements. The system architecture follows a pipeline approach where specialized agents handle different aspects of the software development lifecycle.

## Core Components

### 1. AI Model Infrastructure

The Qwen3:8b model serves as the cognitive foundation for all agents, providing:

- Natural language understanding and generation
- Code analysis and generation capabilities
- Reasoning and planning abilities

The model is loaded once and shared across agents through an efficient infrastructure that manages:

- Model loading and optimization
- Context handling
- Response generation
- Memory management

### 2. CrewAI Framework Integration

The CrewAI framework provides the infrastructure for agent coordination:

- Agent definition and specialization
- Task assignment and management
- Inter-agent communication protocols
- Memory sharing between agents

### 3. File System Management

The system uses a smart file system to enable collaborative development:

- File locking mechanisms to prevent conflicts
- Read access to locked files for review
- Change tracking and versioning
- Real-time visualization of file system changes

### 4. Memory System

Agents maintain both short-term and long-term memory:

- Short-term memory: Current context and active tasks
- Long-term memory: Domain knowledge and patterns
- Shared memory: Information accessible to all agents

## Agent Architecture

Each agent follows a standard architecture pattern:

1. **Input Processing**: Parsing and understanding incoming requests or data
2. **Context Building**: Gathering relevant information from memory and file system
3. **Reasoning Engine**: Making decisions based on agent specialization
4. **Output Generation**: Producing appropriate outputs (PRD, tasks, code, etc.)
5. **Status Management**: Updating task status and shared state

## Communication Protocols

Agents communicate through:

1. **Task Messages**: Direct communications attached to specific tasks
2. **File System**: Changes to shared files
3. **Status Updates**: Changes to task status
4. **Team Board**: Visibility into current activities

## Security & Permissions

The system implements security measures:

- File access controls
- Agent permission boundaries
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
